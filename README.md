KKBOX's Open API provides various data from KKBOX's rich music archive. It helps
you to access data about KKBOX's song tracks, albums, artist playlist and so on.

This is a pure Swift implementation of a client to access KKBOX's Open API. You
can easily integrate the SDK into your iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS project using
Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

The SDK leverages lots of powerful features of Swift programming language, such
as wrapping API responses into enums, and the JSON encoder / decoder since Swift
4.

On the other hand, the SDK could not be called in your Objective-C code
directly. If you need to work with KKBOX's Open API in your Objective-C code,
you may need to wrap the SDK in your own bridging code, or, you may want to take
a look of KKBOX's [Objective-C SDK](https://github.com/KKBOX/OpenAPI-ObjectiveC)

For further information, please visit
[KKBOX Developer Site](https://docs-en.kkbox.codes).

## Requirement

The SDK supports

- Swift 4.2
- üì± iOS 9.x or above
- üíª Mac OS X 10.10 or above
- ‚åöÔ∏è watchOS 2.x or above
- üì∫ tvOS 9.x or above

Ths SDK uses
[NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession)
to do HTTP connections. Since NSURLSession has not been ported to Linux, you
cannot run the Swift SDK on Linux yet, even Swift runs on Linux.

## Build ‚öí

You need the latest Xcode and macOS. Xcode 9 and macOS 10.13 High
Sierra are recommended.

## Installation

The SDK supports both CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager.

### CocoaPods

The SDK supports CocoaPods. Please add `pod 'KKBOXOpenAPISwift'`
to your Podfile, and then call `pod install`.

### Carthage

Add the following line to your `Cartfile`

```
github 'KKBOX/OpenAPI-Swift'
```

Then run `carthage update`.

### Swift Package Manager

Add the SDK as a dependency to your Package.swift:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "KKBOXOpenAPI-test",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "KKBOXOpenAPI-test", targets: ["YourTargetName"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/KKBOX/OpenAPI-Swift", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.1.6"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YourTargetName", dependencies: ["KKBOXOpenAPISwift"], path: "./Path/To/Your/Sources")
    ]
)
```

## Usage

To start using the SDK, you need to create an instance of KKBOXOpenAPI.

``` swift
let API = KKBOXOpenAPI(clientID: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
```

Then, ask the instance to fetch an access token by passing a client credential.

``` swift
_ = try? self.API.fetchAccessTokenByClientCredential { result in
    switch result {
    case .error(let error):
        // Handle error...
    case .success(_):
        // Successfully logged-in
    }
}
```

Finally, you can start to do the API calls. For example, you can fetch the details
of a song track by calling 'fetchTrack'.

``` swift
_ = try? self.API.fetch(track: "4kxvr3wPWkaL9_y3o_") { result in
    switch result {
    case .error(let error):
        // Handle error...
    case .success(let track):
        // Handle the song track.
    }
}
```

You can develop your app using the SDK with Swift or Objective-C programming
language, although we have only Swift sample code here.
